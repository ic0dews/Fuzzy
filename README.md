# Fuzzy
A simple tool for fuzzing written in python. This is meant to be used for fuzzing applications. Its pretty straight forward in use and can deliver custom payloads in large amounts which is perfect for fuzzing.

```

## How to Use
```
git clone https://github.com/cyphres/Fuzzy
```
```
cd Fuzzy
```
Once you have that setup you can startup Fuzzy. 
```
python Fuzzy.py

```
After that you will be asked for the target ip of your application (You put in whatever you want here), after that you can deliver your payload (User inputted) and then you can deliver this payload as many times as you want in a loop of 1 seconds.
